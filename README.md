# CX-Cloud-from-Genesys-and-Salesforce-Screen-Pop

CX Cloud from Genesys and Salesforce has a limitation that only the screen pop of built-in voice call record and contact records using [Object Linking](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.voice_pt_developer_guide.meta/voice_pt_developer_guide/voice_pt_record_linking.htm "Opens the Record Linking section in Salesforce Developer documentation") are supported

Some customers prefer to screen pop different objects instead of the Contact object, such as Account (Personal Account).

This project utilizes Flow for Record Link and a Lightning Web Component (LWC) to open the linked records as subtabs (screen pop).

# Configuration of Salesforce

1.  From Setup, enter Channel-Object in the Quick Find box, then select **Channel-Object Linking**.
2.  Turn off the Channel-Object Linking or disable the Channel-Object Linking Rules for Phone.
3.  From Setup, enter Partner Telephony Setup, scroll the page to the bottom and find **Match Callers to End User Records** (Turn Off).

## Deployment

In VSCode, right-click on the manifest (package.xml) and select **SFDX: Deploy Source in Manifest to Org** to deploy the source to your Salesforce organization.

## What will be deployed ?

- **Flow: Voice_Call_Set_Related_Record**  
  When a Voice Call record is created, this flow will be triggered. The flow searches for an Account by matching the phone number to the `FromPhoneNumber` field of the Voice Call. If a match is found, the flow will update the Voice Callâ€™s "Related Record" field with the corresponding Account.

- **LWC Component: voiceCallOpenRelatedRecordAsSubTab**  
  Please edit your Voice Call Lightning record page and add the `voiceCallOpenRelatedRecordAsSubTab` component to the page. You can place it anywhere on the page, as this component doesn't display any content. It simply provides functionality to open related records in a subtab.
